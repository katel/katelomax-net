Sometimes you just have to make do with shared web hosting and all of the caveats that come with that.</p>\n<p>These are some collected notes about troubleshooting Omeka installation on shared hosting based on some of my own trial and error and some useful responses from the kind people on the <a href=\"http://omeka.org/forums/\">Omeka support forums</a>.</p>\n<p>The full requirements for installing Omeka available <a href=\"http://omeka.org/codex/Preparing_to_Install\">here</a> but it's the <em>mod_rewrite</em> and <em>ImageMagick</em> ones that can be particular bugbears.</p>\n<p>There are a list of <a href=\"http://omeka.org/codex/Hosting_Suggestions\">'Hosting suggestions'</a> on the Omeka site to help spare you some of this pain but they are largely US-based and focused on academic institutions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enable-development-mode\">Enable development mode</h3>\n<p>The first step in troubleshooting is to know what the trouble is that you're .. ummm .. shooting. You can enable error reporting on Omeka by uncommenting the relevant line in the .htaccess file in your root directory</p>\n<p><code>SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV development</code></p>\n<h3 id=\"imagemagick\">ImageMagick</h3>\n<p>ImageMagick is required by Omeka for resizing and processing images and other file uploads. You can install Omeka but it requires shell access to the server which isn't available on a lot of shared hosting (<a href=\"https://www.webfaction.com/\">Webfaction</a> is the only exception that springs to mind).</p>\n<p>First, if you have ImageMagick installed it a) has to be the executable version and b) you need to know the location so you can add this to the admin settings. This is usually /usr/bin but not always.</p>\n<p>You can check the directory path is added correctly from the Admin settings page</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://katelomax.net/images/omeka-directory-path-screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"ImageMagick directory path\"></p>\n<p>If you're on shared hosting and ImageMagick either isn't installed or otherwise isn't working, you can try using the PHP extension instead of the executable version of ImageMagick. This is via the imagick PECL package that can be installed from cPanel.</p>\n<p>You'll need to update the configuration to bypass the expected ImageMagick setup.</p>\n<p>In the application/config/config.ini file, uncomment the line and change it from:</p>\n<p><code>fileDerivatives.strategy = \"Omeka_File_Derivative_Strategy_ExternalImageMagick\"</code></p>\n<p>to:</p>\n<p><code>fileDerivatives.strategy = \"Omeka_File_Derivative_Strategy_Imagick\"</code></p>\n<p>This will remove the directory path option from the settings page but will allow you to upload files to items in your Omeka collection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"too-many-redirects\">Too many redirects</h3>\n<p>Another issue you might encounter is that ol' 'too many redirects ' loop when trying to access the installer.</p>\n<p>This can usually be resolved by ensuring there is an .htaccess file in the installation directory as well as the site's root folder:</p>\n<p>Something like:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"highlight plaintext\">&lt;Files install.php&gt;\nAllow from all\n&lt;/Files&gt;\n\n&lt;Files mod-rewrite.php&gt;\nAllow from all\n&lt;/Files&gt;\n\n&lt;Files check-mod-rewrite.html&gt;\nAllow from all\n&lt;/Files&gt;\n\n# This allows us to verify that mod_rewrite is enabled\n&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;\nRewriteEngine On\n\n# If know that mod_rewrite is enabled, but you are still getting mod_rewrite errors,\n# uncomment the line below and replace \"/install/\" with your install directory.\n# RewriteBase /install/\n\nRewriteRule ^check-mod-rewrite([^/]*)\\.html$ mod-rewrite.php?enabled=true [L]\n&lt;/IfModule&gt;\n</code></pre>",

            "content_html": "<p><em>First published on the <a href=\"http://www.artefacto.org.uk\">Artefacto</a> blog.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"an-intro\">An intro</h2>\n<p><em>Making Library Makers; An Intro</em> was the first event for library makers run jointly by Artefacto and the Makercart Project. The event was created for staff in libraries who were interested in running maker events or otherwise learning more about the maker movement and makerspaces.</p>\n<p>It was held at Makerversity, a co-working, membership-based makerspace located in the depths of Somerset House.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-library-makers\">Why Library Makers?</h2>\n<p>When we talk about 'making' and 'maker culture', we're referring to a widespread movement to create environments that enable and support learning and creativity with new and emerging technologies. This includes makerspaces, fab labs, hackerspaces, repair cafes and TechShops (though there are subtle differences, <a href=\"http://makezine.com/2013/05/22/the-difference-between-hackerspaces-makerspaces-techshops-and-fablabs/\">depending on who you ask</a>).</p>\n<p>A lot of the time, maker culture is described based on a set of tools and technologies but the specific technology involved is both fluid and largely beside the point. It's really about providing an active learning space - with a focus on creativity, open technology and collaboration.</p>\n<p>All of the things that maker culture and makerspaces brought to the fore were things that had been a part of the library remit already.</p>\n<p>Digital literacy and digital skills training has long been a part of public library services but the focus is often on 'web' literacy and specific digital skills. But with technology changing so rapidly and so constantly, how do we best support and prepare users with the right skills?</p>\n<p>This is where 'making' comes in - it brings about a great opportunity to reimagine how we support digital literacy in libraries.</p>\n<p>Above all else, the library is a learning space which is why they are such a good fit with makerspaces. It's about providing support for people to learn how to engage with new technologies creatively, collaboratively and critically.</p>\n<h2 id=\"on-the-day\">On the day</h2>\n<p>This was very much an introductory event and though it was short, there was lots of interesting discussions for those who had either attended or provided maker workshops in their library.</p>\n<p>Based on previous events run by Carlos (who's behind the Makercart project), the event included 'speed making' where participants got a chance to play with various maker tools and equipment, including a 3D Printer, Digital Cutter, LittleBits and MaKey MaKey. There was also a collection of books and magazines about the maker movement available.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.makercarto.org.uk\">Makercart project</a> is a readymade 'makerspace' equipped to help libraries provide maker events and support without a huge amount of overheads.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.librarymakers.net\">LibraryMakers</a> is a new website being developed to help library staff get the support they need in providing maker activities in their libraries.</p>\n<p>The aim was to give people a chance to try out some different tech resources and ask any questions they might have, either to us or to others in the library sector who had been exploring maker type activities already.</p>\n<p>Despite a strict schedule and a Mega Mystery Maze of a venue, everyone got a chance to try out the tools available, play a banana keyboard (or banana bongos), make circuits with LittleBits, 3D print something and use a digital cutter.</p>\n<p>One of the things that we want to emphasis is that 'making' is a big, amorphous area - we're certainly not recommending any kind of uniform approach for libraries in different sectors and different communities. While getting a chance to try out some new tech tools that you haven't used before is part of it, so is the chance to discuss ideas, plans and stumbling blocks with others in the library world.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-next\">What next</h2>\n<p>We're planning further events, including some more in-depth training around specific hardware and electronics and other areas related to 'making'.</p>\n<p>If you're interested in finding out more or attending future events, please sign up to the mailing list at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/bOzGkz\">http://eepurl.com/bOzGkz</a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>One of the great things about Interactive Fiction frameworks like <a href=\"http://twinery.org\">Twine</a> and <a href=\"http://undum.com/\">Undum</a> is that their application extends far beyond creating linear text-based games (and the skies the limit, as even a cursory a glance at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/twinethreads\">TwineThreads</a> Twitter feed shows).</p>\n<p>It's no secret that online learning suffers from high abandonment rates. It often still falls down when it comes to providing an interactive, learner-led and social learning experience and this is one of the reasons that MOOCs and other recent developments still haven't quite cracked the user engagement code.</p>\n<p>Interactive fiction uses a \"choose your own adventure\" (for want of a better, less-trademarked term) structure. It's an interesting model for learning activities because it provides choices (and the possibility of a range of outcomes). And this can lead to learning pathways that reflect both the experiences and the goals of the learner.</p>\n<p>Twine is an open source framework for creating text-based games. You can see a showcase of Twine-produced games via the Twine website at <a href=\"http://twinery.org/\">twinery.org</a> but I guess the most well-know example is <a href=\"http://www.depressionquest.com/dqfinal.html\">Depression Quest</a>.</p>\n<p>Twine is a great tool for active learning and very easy to get started with. You don't necessarily need coding skills to create a Twine - though it certainly helps when it comes to adding additional interactions and other advanced features. There's a new online Twine authoring tool in beta and Twine clients for both Mac and Windows.</p>\n<p>This is the <em>why</em> of Twine, I'll be looking into <em>How</em> to use Twine for creative learning in an upcoming post.</p>",
